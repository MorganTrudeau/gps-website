        <h4>What is the benefit of tracking your vehicle with GPS?</h4>
        <p>
          A GPS tracker lets you monitor your vehicle remotely. It will playback
          its recent trips, show how fast it is going, and when it is stopped.
          This information can help you track down stolen vehicles, locate your
          car when you're away, and even prevent accidents.
